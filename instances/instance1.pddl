;; Instance 1) we consider a scenario composed of three sidewalks, three taxis and two
;; people waiting to be taken to their destination. Specifically, we consider the initial state
;; where person p1 is waiting at sidewalk 1 and person p2 is waiting at sidewalk 3. The taxis in
;; the initial configuration are positioned as follows: taxi_A is parked at sidewalk 1, taxi_B is
;; parked at sidewalk 2, and taxi_C is parked at sidewalk 3. The goal state, on the other hand,
;; is represented by the following configuration: person p1 is at sidewalk 2, person p2 is at
;; sidewalk 3, taxi_A is parked at sidewalk 2, taxi_B is parked at sidewalk 3 and taxi_C is
;; parked at sidewalk 1.
